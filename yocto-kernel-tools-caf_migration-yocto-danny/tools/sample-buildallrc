# More control over what gets built and what doesn't can be done
# with the following black/white lists and black/white regex.
# Any/all can be specified, and they are treated as a logical
# AND of each (i.e. a meta must "pass" each criteria to get used).
#
# List of meta series you want to skip
# BLACKLIST="mti-malta64-be-preempt-rt-meta ti-omap3-standard-meta"

# A regex that can blacklist a whole family
# BLACKREGEX="routerstation.*"

# List of explicit meta that are to be built (all others skipped)
# WHITELIST="common-pc-preempt-rt-meta atom-pc-standard-meta"

# A regex that can whitelist a whole family
# WHITEREGEX=".*-preempt-rt-meta"

# Set this if you want to limit the total number of builds.
# MAX_BUILDS=5

# Set this if you are working from a freshly generated tree, and
# there is no need to regenerate the meta-series (since they can't
# be stale).  Don't set this if you don't understand the above.
